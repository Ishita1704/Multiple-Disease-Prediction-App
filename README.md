🧠 Multi-Disease Prediction App: Parkinson's, Heart Disease, and Diabetes
This application provides a user-friendly web interface for predicting the risk of Parkinson's Disease, Heart Disease, and Diabetes using specialized Machine Learning models. Early risk assessment can be a crucial step toward preventive healthcare.

✨ Features
Parkinson's Disease Prediction: Utilizes biomedical voice measurements (e.g., NHR, HNR, Jitter, Shimmer, as shown in the screenshot) to assess the risk of the disease.

Heart Disease Prediction: Predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on standard clinical and demographic features (e.g., age, cholesterol, blood pressure).

Diabetes Prediction: Predicts the risk of diabetes based on key health indicators (e.g., glucose levels, BMI, age).

Intuitive Interface: Easy-to-use forms powered by Streamlit (or similar framework) for inputting health parameters.

Clear Results: Displays the prediction outcome (e.g., "High Risk," "Low Risk") for each disease.
